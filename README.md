This repository contains a sample ASP.NET project demonstrating how to perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations using Entity Framework in an ASP.NET application. Three different approaches—Code-First, Database-First, and Model-First—are implemented to showcase the flexibility of Entity Framework.

### Approach
1. **Code-First Approach**: Start with domain classes and let Entity Framework generate the database schema.
2. **Database-First Approach**: Design the database schema and use Entity Framework to generate the entity classes.
3. **Model-First Approach**: Use Entity Framework Designer to create an entity model and generate the database schema from it.
